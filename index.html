    <h1>My life</h1>
    <h2>Imagine Dragons</h2>
    <p>
      Can I wish on a star for another life?<br />
      'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight<br />
      And I find myself in pieces<br />
      There are pills on the table and a thought in my head<br />
      And I walk through the halls where I used to be led<br />
      My heart is filled with reasons<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm tryin' to be somebody else<br />
      I'm findin' it hard to love myself<br />
      I've wanted to be somebody new<br />
      But that is impossible to do<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm runnin' out of my mind<br />
      Is this really my life?<br />
      I'm runnin' out of time<br />
      Is this really my life? My life<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I could run from it all but I'd only get lost<br />
      Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed<br />
      And I find myself, a user<br />
      Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed<br />
      They all call me a friend but I'll never be freed<br />
      From the face of a faithless future<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm tryin' to be somebody else<br />
      I'm findin' it hard to love myself<br />
      I've wanted to be somebody new<br />
      But that is impossible to do<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm runnin' out of my mind<br />
      Is this really my life?<br />
      I'm runnin' out of time<br />
      Is this really my life? My life<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These years pass by and we're growin' older<br />
      And I think of you, all we've made it through<br />
      Some have passed away, some have moved on<br />
      But I'm still here today (I'm here today)<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These years pass by and I'm growin' older<br />
      And I think of you, and all we've made it through<br />
      Some have passed away, there's no words to say<br />
      No second tries, is this my life?<br />
      And I think of you<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm runnin' out of my mind<br />
      Is this really my life?<br />
      I'm runnin' out of time<br />
      Is this really my life? My life<br />
